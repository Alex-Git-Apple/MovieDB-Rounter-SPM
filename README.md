# Sample project for SwiftLeeds conference talk

# Description:
This is a sample project of my SwiftLeeds talk. It's all about modularizing a monolith app into a multi-packages app using Swift Package Manager (SPM).

# Important notes:
You'll find four different branches:
* `main` that is the monolith app
* `feature/modularization-phase1` and `feature/modularization-phase2` with the app modularized with cyclic dependencies
* `feature/modularization-phase3` with the app modularized without cyclic dependencies (navigation logic extracted)

Please let me know if you have any feedback. I'll love to hear from you ðŸ˜Š.
